                        <p>
                            My name is Tanner Woodrum! I am a member of the Church of 
                            Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a student at BYU, a technology enthusiast,
                            and most importantly I am a child of God!<br><br>
                            I love to do many things, but here are just 4 of the top ones: <br>
                            <ol>
                                <li><a href="#resume">My Resumé</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#calisthenics">Calisthenics</a></li>

                            </ol>
                            <br>
                            My resumé shows how I love 
                            to help people and learn new concepts. I was recently admitted to the
                            Informational Systems (IS) program at Brigham Young University this Summer. I cannot
                            wait to do many great things in this world via technology. Please feel free
                            to click on My Resumé above to explore what I have accomplished, learned, and done.<br><Br>

                            Calisthenics is my chosen method of workout. This style of working out integrates 
                            interesting and fun workouts that help you develop skills such as the muscle-up, the
                            handstand hold, planches, levers, and so much more! Click on Calisthenics above to explore more
                            about what it all entails.<br><Br>

                            I love football! I have played football for most of my life and could not have loved it more.
                            To see a little bit more about why I love football and what positions I played, click on Football above!<br><Br>
                            
                            Running is the way that I relax and clear my head. Have you ever worked so much on a project, or on 
                            homework and you just can't seem to get into a groove and you have found yourself in a rut? I surely
                            have! But when this happens to me, my favorite thing ever to do is go on a run and clearn my head and 
                            thoughts so that I can start over and come back with a fresh take on things. Click on Running above to 
                            see some more thoughts on running!

                            In this image, these are Calisthenics rings that are used for this type of training.
                            They train for balance and majority of the muscle groups.<br><br>

                            Calisthenics is a type of workout that primarily uses body weight to build 
                            the large muscle groups. This type of workout focuses on building the entire body as one
                            strong unit, rather than focusing on building only one type of muscle group.<br><br>

                            Before Calisthenics, I had always done weight training in a weight room because that is what we would do for strength
                            training in football. When I got to college, I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep doing heavy weight training because
                            I was worried it would hurt my body. So, one day I went on a run and began doing some HIIT workouts, when someone
                            approached me and asked if I wanted to join the BYU calisthenics club and I told them I had never heard of it before 
                            and they told me to come to the club meeting to find out. Ever since then I have been so pleased with how it trains 
                            my body and helps me feel good!

                        <p>As I grew up in a small town in Texas, football became my life! It was such an amazing experience. I was able to start
                            playing tackle football when I was 10 years old and stopped when I was 18 as a senior! This sport taught me so much about
                            life. I learned about hard work, dedication, friendship, and trust. I loved every moment of it!<br><br>

                            I started out playing as a tight end when I was 10, and then I moved to be a running back on offense and a strong safety
                            on defense. I absolutely loved both! From there, when I was in middle school, I stayed as a running back but then was
                            converted to be a free safety on defense. I loved every second of it! Finally as a Junior on Varsity, I was placed to be
                            a cornerback until the end of my senior year! It was such a great experience to be out there playing with my friends 
                            and learning from my coaches.

                        <p>I love running! As I've said before, running is my way to just open my mind and get out and relax. The 
                            world moves so fast and so it is absolutely necessary to slow down and clear your mind. I love doing this by
                            getting outdoors and just going on a run. Whenever I do this, I feel so much better and then I am able to do so 
                            much more when I get back!
